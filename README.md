Welcome to RedirectGuard, your guardian against scam websites! This Chrome extension is designed to enhance your online security by automatically redirecting you from potentially harmful or scam websites to their legitimate counterparts. We understand the prevalence of phishing attempts and deceptive URLs, and RedirectGuard is here to provide an additional layer of protection.
