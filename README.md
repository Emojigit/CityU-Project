# RedirectGuard Chrome Extension

## Introduction

Welcome to RedirectGuard, a concept designed to revolutionize your online security. Our vision for this Chrome extension is to incorporate advanced AI models or integrate the VirusTotal API to dynamically assess the security status of websites in real-time. By doing so, we aim to provide you with an intelligent shield against potential scams and phishing attempts.

## How the Future Version Will Work

### 1. AI-Powered Scam Detection

In the envisioned version, RedirectGuard will harness the power of artificial intelligence to analyze URLs dynamically. By training a sophisticated AI model, we aim to detect and identify potential scam websites based on evolving patterns and emerging threats.

### 2. VirusTotal Integration (Inspired By Google Staff Members)

Alternatively, we are exploring the integration of the VirusTotal API, a robust platform that aggregates information from multiple antivirus engines and website scanners. This approach will allow RedirectGuard to query the API for the security status of the websites you visit, ensuring a comprehensive and up-to-date threat assessment.

### 3. Seamless User Experience

Our goal is to maintain a seamless user experience, where the extension operates intelligently in the background. Whether using AI algorithms or leveraging the VirusTotal API, RedirectGuard will automatically redirect you to the secure version of the website, ensuring a safe and smooth browsing experience.

## The Road Ahead

1. **AI Training and Development:**
   - We are actively researching and developing AI models tailored for scam detection, with the aim of providing a proactive defense against evolving online threats.

2. **VirusTotal Integration:**
   - Exploring integration possibilities with the VirusTotal API to fetch real-time security assessments for websites.

3. **User Feedback:**
   - We encourage users to provide feedback on false positives or any issues encountered, helping us refine and improve RedirectGuard continuously.

## Privacy and Security

Our commitment to your privacy remains paramount. As we progress with this concept, we ensure that all security assessments are conducted locally on your device, with no sensitive information stored or transmitted.
